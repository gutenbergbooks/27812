	<h2 class="title">The Pursuit of Truth.</h2>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“To be loyal to the truth is of more account than to be merely successful
		in formulating it.”—<cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite> for December.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Indeed it is; for loyalty to truth is the prior condition of success
	in formulating or stating it, and that loyalty not only precedes the
	special success in formulating it, but is the prior cause of <em>universal
	success</em> in its attainment. Special perceptive powers and favorable
	opportunities may enable scientists to ascertain certain truths, as a
	lamp may enable them to discover a few objects near them which
	darkness hides from others, but loyalty to truth reveals, like daylight,
	all that lies within our horizon, for it opens widely all the
	avenues between the mind and universal nature, and prevents our
	mental transparency from being darkened in any direction or relation.
	He who has this loyalty dominant in his nature never pronounces
	anything false which subsequent investigation, or the investigation
	by others, proves true. He never becomes an obstacle to the spread
	of any truth. He is always the first to welcome a new truth and the
	last to falter in sustaining it. He is always ready to recognize the
	same sincerity and fidelity in others, and to give a kindly welcome to
	the labors and discoveries of other followers of truth. As brave men
	readily recognize and honor each other, so do the soldiers of truth
	meet in quick sympathy and cordial co-operation.</p>

	<p>The labors, the discoveries and promulgations of such men ever
	become criteria by which to test the loyalty and truthfulness of
	others, for, wherever they are presented, all who live in loyalty to
	truth are at once attracted and realize their harmony with the truth.
	As the magnetized iron attracts the unmagnetized, so does the loyal
	soul charged with truth attract all other loyal souls.</p>

	<p>But all through human history we find that inventions, discoveries
	and, above all, momentous truths uniformly fail to attract the masses,
	either of the learned or the unlearned, as was illustrated in our
	December number, and hence we must conclude that, in the present
	early or juvenile stage of human evolution, loyalty to truth is one of
	the rarest virtues of humanity.</p>

	<p>And yet, how often do we meet in literature expressions which
	would indicate that the writers were entirely loyal. They mistake
	loyalty to their own self-esteem, loyalty to their own dogmatic convictions,
	mental limitations, prejudices, and prepossessions for loyalty
	to truth, which is a passionless, modest, lovely and noble quality.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>No doubt the contemporaries of Galileo, Newton, and Harvey
	indulged in the same self-gratulations. The bigot and dogmatist in
	all ages have entertained no doubt of their own loyalty to truth;
	but it was loyalty to their own very limited perceptions, and to their
	profound conviction that all outside of their own sphere of perception
	was falsehood or nonentity, and should be received with supercilious
	scorn or crushing blows whenever presented.</p>

	<p>Men’s minds are thus narrowed in the base contests of selfishness,
	jealousy, and fraud; but of all the demoralizing influences that
	darken the mind by closing up permanently its most important
	inlets, none have had such a wide-spread and far-reaching power for
	evil as the false theology which demands the absolute surrender of
	reason to self-evident absurdities.</p>

	<p>Benumbed by countless centuries of superstition and passive surrender
	to false education, to social influences, to pre-natal conditions,
	to the terrors of law and custom, and to the lurid threats and horrors
	of the imaginary drama of eternity, the mass of mankind have
	lost the power of the dispassionate philosophical reasoning demanded
	by loyalty to truth, and they do not know how to appreciate it when
	they see it.</p>

	<p>Rebelling now against this limitation and slavery, they still carry
	in their rebellion the marks of their slavery, and in their honest
	agnosticism they still fail to reason fairly in loyalty to truth, and
	indulge in the same dogmatism, narrowness or prejudice as when
	they were slaves to priestly dogmas.</p>

	<p>It is true that in the agnostic scientific classes there is far more
	independent reasoning capacity generally than among those who
	dwell in the theological limitations, but their independence has not
	relieved them from the dogmatism which has so long been cultivated
	in the human race by all religious systems. The dogmatism of the
	medical college, and of most scientific associations, rivals that of theological
	sectarianism.</p>

	<p>The <cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite>, from which the above expression
	in behalf of loyalty to truth was taken, is itself a striking illustration
	of <em>disloyalty</em>, and rigidly confines itself to the fashionable doctrines of
	the schools, excluding from its pages whatever differs from the
	prevalent scientific dogmatism, and while denouncing the dogmatism
	of theology, exhibiting itself a dogmatism equally blind, unreasoning
	and regardless of facts. Experimental demonstrations and scientific
	facts, which transcend the limits of their arbitrary theories, receive
	as little attention from the dogmatists trained in medical schools, as
	they would from a college of cardinals.</p>

	<p>The <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>, in the presentation of new truths, attracts
	only the candid, loyal and progressive. It does not hope to conquer
	the results of inheritance, pre-natal influence and old institutions, or
	force any truth upon reluctant and disloyal minds, but it knows that
	there is an important and growing class who sympathize with loyalty
	and prefer the glowing future to the decaying remains of the past.</p>

	<p>To the party of progress, this magnificent republic opens a free
	and ample field. The domination of habit and transmitted dogmatism
	<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>is growing continually weaker, fading away in churches and
	colleges. The pulpit of today is tolerant indeed in comparison with
	the pulpit of our fathers, and the bright, free thought of the advanced
	people surrounds the colleges with an atmosphere which is
	gradually penetrating their walls and modifying their policy. An
	important duty devolves upon every loyal, progressive thinker,—the
	duty of speaking out firmly, manfully and distinctly, to swell the
	volume of thought which carries mankind onward to a nobler
	future.</p>

<div id="art2" class="article">
	<h2 class="title">Occultism Defined.</h2>

	<p class="byline">BY ONE WHO KNOWS.</p>

	<p>My own claims to be considered as an exponent of true Occultism
	are founded upon the following grounds: When quite young, in
	fact, before I had attained my thirteenth year, I became acquainted
	with certain parties who sought me out and professed a desire to
	observe the somnambulic faculties for which I was then remarkable.
	I found my new associates to be ladies and gentlemen, mostly persons
	of noble rank, and during a period of several years, I, and
	many other young persons, assisted at their sessions in the quality
	of somnambulists, or mesmeric subjects. The persons I thus came
	into contact with were representatives of many other countries than
	Great Britain. They formed one of a number of secret societies,
	and all that I am privileged to relate of them is, that they were
	students of the two branches of Occultism hereafter to be described;
	that they claimed an affiliation with societies derived from the
	ancient mysteries of Egypt, Greece, and Judæa; that their beliefs
	and practices had been concealed from the vulgar by cabalistic
	methods, and that though their real origin and the purpose of their
	association had at times been almost lost, it had revived, and been
	restored under many aspects. They claimed that alchemy,
	mediæval Rosicrucianism, and modern Freemasonry were off-shoots
	of the original Cabala, and that during the past 150 years new
	associations had been formed, and the parties who had introduced
	me into their arcanum were a society in affiliation with many
	others then in existence in different countries. These persons,
	deeming that the intrusion into their ranks of unprepared minds
	would be injurious to the harmony necessary for their studies, carefully
	avoided assuming any position of prominence in reference to
	the society, so that they might never be solicited to admit those
	whose presence might be prejudicial. Indeed it was one of their
	leading regulations never to permit the existence of the society to
	be known or the members thereof named, until they passed from
	earth to the higher life. It is in virtue of this last clause that I am
	at liberty to say that Lord Lytton, the Earl of Stanhope, and Lieut.
	Morrison (better known as “Zadkiel”), and the author of “Art
	Magic,” belonged to this society.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>I should have known but little of its principles and practices, as I
	was simply what I should now call a clairvoyant, sought out by the
	society for my gifts in this direction, had I not, in later years, been
	instructed in the fundamentals of the society by the author of “Art
	Magic.” When modern spiritualism dawned upon the world, for
	special reasons of my own, the fellows of my society gave me an
	honorary release from every obligation I had entered into with them
	except in the matter of secrecy. On that point I can never be released
	and never seek to be; but in respect to the statements I am
	about to make, my former associates,—deeming their publication
	might serve to correct some of the erroneous opinions that are put
	into circulation by individuals who arrogate to themselves a knowledge,
	of which they have not the slightest iota,—not only sanction,
	but command me to present to the candid inquirer the following
	brief definition of genuine practical</p>

	<p class="subtitle">OCCULTISM—ANCIENTLY WRITTEN IN “CABALA.”</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Occultism</strong> is a study and application of the occult, or hidden
	principles and forces of the Universe, or, in its more limited sense,
	of Nature.</p>

	<p>The study of occultism is called speculative. The application of
	that study is practical occultism.</p>

	<p>Speculative occultism includes opinions and teachings, often so
	widely at variance with commonly received beliefs that it would be
	extremely unwise to subject it to the criticism of persons generically
	called the world. Speculative occultism of course might be regarded
	as <em>speculative only</em>, were it not possible by the aid of practical
	occultism to demonstrate its truths.</p>

	<p>The subjects which engage the attention of the speculative
	occultist are <strong class="emphasis">The Creator</strong>, or creative power; <strong class="emphasis">World Building</strong>,
	and the order and design of the earth and its spirit spheres; <strong class="emphasis">Man</strong>,
	and his relations to the Creator, the earth, and his fellow-man.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Descent of Spirit</strong> into matter, and its growth through embryotic
	stages, during which period it is first <em>elemental</em>, then <em>animal</em>, then <em>man</em>.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Ascent of Spirit</strong> out of matter, and its progress through future
	stages of growth as planetary and solar spirits.</p>

	<p>Besides these purely theoretical subjects are suggestions concerning
	the best methods of communing with spiritual existences, and
	of receiving information from lower and higher states than man.
	These, together with <em>some mental exercises and practices</em>, form the
	main themes of consideration in the colleges of speculative occultism.
	Spirit Communion, together with Astronomy, Astrology,
	Mathematics, Geometry, Music, Anatomy, Physiology, Psychology,
	and Psychometry, are all kindred branches of study which must
	engage the attention of the true occultist.</p>

	<p class="subtitle">PRACTICAL OCCULTISM.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Practical Occultism</strong> consists, first, of a perfect mastery of the
	individual’s <em>own spirit</em>. No advance whatever can be made in acquiring
	power over other spirits, such as controlling the lower or
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>supplicating the higher, until the spirit within has acquired such perfect
	mastery of itself, that it can never be moved to anger or emotion—realizes
	no pleasure, cares for no pain; experiences no mortification
	at insult, loss, or disappointment—in a word, subdues every emotion
	that stirs common men’s minds.</p>

	<p>To arrive at this state, severe and painful as well as long continued
	discipline is necessary. Having acquired this perfect <em>equilibrium</em>,
	the next step is <em>power</em>. The individual must be able to
	wake when he pleases and sleep when he pleases; go in spirit
	during bodily sleep where he will, and visit—as well as remember
	when awake—distant scenes.</p>

	<p>He must be enabled by practice, to telegraph, mentally, with his
	fellow associates, and present himself, spiritually, in their midst.</p>

	<p>He must, by practice, acquire psychological control over the
	minds of any persons—not his associates—<em>beneath</em> his own calibre
	of mind. He must be able to still a crying infant, subdue fierce
	animals or angry men, and by will, transfer his thought without
	speech or outward sign to any person of a mental calibre below
	himself; he must be enabled to summon to his presence elementary
	spirits, and if he desires to do so (knowing the penalties attached),
	to make them serve him in the special departments of Nature to
	which they belong.</p>

	<p>He must, by virtue of complete subjugation of his earthly nature,
	be able to invoke Planetary and even Solar Spirits, and commune
	with them to a certain degree.</p>

	<p>To attain these degrees of power the processes are so difficult that
	a thorough practical occultist can scarcely become one and yet continue
	his relations with his fellow-men.</p>

	<p>He must continue, from the first to the last degree, a long series of
	exercises, each one of which must be perfected before another is
	undertaken.</p>

	<p>A practical occultist may be of either sex, but must observe as the
	first law inviolable chastity—and that with a view of conserving all
	the virile powers of the organism. No aged person, especially one
	who has not lived the life of strict chastity, can acquire the full sum
	of the powers above named. It is better to commence practice in
	early youth, for after the meridian of life, when the processes of
	waste prevail over repair, few of the powers above described can be
	attained; the full sum never.</p>

	<p>Strict abstinence from animal food and all stimulants is necessary.
	Frequent ablutions and long periods of silent contemplation are
	essential. Codes of exercises for the attainment of these powers can
	be prescribed, but few, if any, of the self-indulgent livers of modern
	times can perform their routine.</p>

	<p>The arts necessary for study to the practical occultist are, in
	addition to those prescribed in speculative occultism, a knowledge
	of the qualities of drugs, vapors, minerals, electricity, perfumes,
	fumigations, and all kinds of anæsthetics.</p>

	<p>And now, having given in brief as much as is consistent with my
	position—as the former associate of a secret society—I have simply
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>to add, that, whilst there are, as in Masonry, certain preliminary
	degrees to pass through, there are numerous others to which a
	thoroughly well organized and faithful association might advance.
	In each degree there are some valuable elements of practical occultism
	demanded, whilst the teachings conveyed are essential preliminaries.
	In a word, speculative occultism must precede practical
	occultism; the former is love and wisdom, the latter, simply power.</p>

	<p>In future papers I propose to describe the two Ancient Cabalas,
	and the present attempts to incarnate their philosophy in modern—so-called—Theosophy.</p>

	<hr class="short" />

	<p>In the foregoing essay, taken from the first number of <cite>The Two
	Worlds</cite>, edited by Mrs. E. H. Britten, we have the best exposition of
	Occultism that has been published. It shows that Occultism,
	theoretic and practical, is a matter of intellectual ambition—ambition
	to understand the mysteries of nature, and to wield the power
	which such understanding gives. It exhibits no ulterior purpose of
	using its knowledge for the benefit of mankind, or even of diffusing
	it. Its aim is selfish, and the secrecy which it has maintained is not
	justifiable in the present condition of our civilization.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Anthropology</strong>, which I am endeavoring to introduce for the
	benefit of mankind, comprehends the whole of the theory and practice
	of Occultism, and there is no need for seeking mysterious societies
	for a species of knowledge which is no longer a secret, and which
	will be fully illustrated in my future publications.</p>

	<p>“Practical Occultism,” as defined by Sirius, is perfectly intelligible
	to one who understands the science of the brain. It is an effort to
	cultivate into <em>abnormal</em> predominance the heroic, firm, hardy, and
	spiritual regions of the brain, to the neglect if not suppression of its
	nobler powers. In suppressing sympathy and sensibility, it impairs
	the foundation of our most amiable virtues, isolates man from the
	companionship and love of his fellow-beings and comes dangerously
	near to misanthropy and black magic, or the attempt to use spiritual
	powers and the spiritual realm for purely selfish purposes.</p>

	<p>Bulwer, it is stated, was one of the occult society. In his case the
	pursuit was one of pure selfishness; his motives in his literary career
	were selfish and avaricious; his domestic life was detestable, and the
	use that he made of his knowledge in his literary labors was meretricious
	and fantastic. That noble-minded woman and gifted
	medium, the late Mrs. M. B. Hayden, M. D., was received by him at
	Knebworth, and gave him ample evidence of truths which he never
	publicly sustained.</p>

	<p>Whatever withdraws us from society and from the duties to fellow-beings
	which are incumbent upon all, is unworthy of encouragement.
	The noblest cultivation is symmetrical, and in its symmetry
	maintains the supremacy of the ethical sentiments, which recognize
	human fraternity.</p>

	<p>Nevertheless, this “practical occultism,” abnormal and egotistic
	though it be, may develop marvellous powers, at which we may wonder
	as we do at the skill of an acrobat or the pugilism of Sullivan.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>It cultivates a will power and a spirituality by which miraculous
	phenomena may be shown, but they are of little real value compared
	to the nobler miracle of healing those whom physicians have surrendered
	to death, and bringing to the knowledge of mankind the
	entire truth concerning the future life, and the ennobling lessons
	derived therefrom, which bring earth life nearer to heaven.</p>

	<h2 class="title">Psychic Phenomena.</h2>

	<p>The <cite>New York World</cite> publishes a narrative of psychic experiments
	by its correspondent at Washington which may interest those
	who have not witnessed anything like it. They are just such as
	have been on exhibition publicly in this country for more than forty
	years, but owing to conservative prejudice have not received their
	due attention from the press. But as newspaper correspondents and
	reporters are a privileged class, they can bring before the public
	marvellous phenomena which would not be welcomed from other
	sources. The following is the letter from Washington:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“You know what an excitement there has been about mesmerism
		in Paris this summer? A lion tamer, who was also a mesmerist,
		took into his cages a young lady whom he had mesmerized, and
		made his dentate pets jump over her on the floor. There was great
		excitement about it, and a law was passed in the French Congress,
		I believe, forbidding such exhibitions, even where the consent of the
		subject had been obtained previously to losing consciousness.</p>

		<p>“This letter will be in the nature of a confession. Last spring,
		discovering by accident that I could mesmerize, I took up mesmerism
		as a diversion for the amusement of myself and friends. I had
		long believed in it entirely and carefully watched its processes, but
		I wished to study its philosophy and find out, if I could, the cause
		and the limits of its mysterious phenomena.</p>

		<p>“I first found that I could, by placing my hand on the forehead
		of a young acquaintance and accompanying the slight pressure with
		an imperative command, close his eyes and keep them firmly closed
		against all efforts of his will. I could compel him to dance or keep
		him from moving from his tracks; could prevent his rising from his
		chair; prevent his striking his hands together, and, at last, could
		prevent him from speaking. In fact, I absolutely controlled his
		voluntary muscles in every respect, and could compel him to do
		anything that he was physically capable of doing.</p>

		<p>“Extending the experiments, I obtained the same control over
		others, both men and women, till I had quite a class of sensitives so
		responsive that I could control them with ease. Up to this time
		they were all perfectly conscious and without any hallucinations;
		they knew who they were, where they were and what they were
		doing, and they laughed as heartily at the absurd results obtained as
		any spectator. Up to this time, too, I had no means of ascertaining
		whether the apparent results were genuine. I might be the dupe of
		cunning people who were conspiring to fool me, for, in these early
		stages, there seems to be no way of scientifically proving it.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>“It was some time before I was able to carry the experiments
		further and get control of the consciousness and senses of my class.
		At last success came. I made them see and hear mosquitoes and
		fight the tormentors with great energy. At this point they became
		dazed, and it was easy to command their senses in other respects.
		At a suggestion they heard music, the noises of a riot, a thunderstorm,
		the roaring of lions, a speech by Col. Ingersoll, and they gradually
		came to see vividly anything to which I directed their attention. In
		this world of hallucination they lost consciousness—or, rather, they
		abandoned their real existence and assumed an abnormal existence,
		as one does in a dream.</p>

		<p>“I am not yet certain whether this strange condition is imposed on
		them by my will, or whether it is self-imposed, subjective, and the
		result of expectation on their part. I am inclined to believe the
		latter theory is true, because, when I direct their attention to a
		horse, for instance, each one sees a different sort of horse, and his
		head is in different directions.</p>

		<p>“By a few additional passes I can induce a cataleptic state, in
		which the sensitive becomes perfectly rigid and can be laid out between
		two chairs, his head on one and his heels on another, like a
		log. They can also be easily made insensible to pain, so that pins
		are stuck through their hands, teeth drawn, and painful but harmless
		acids put in the eye, without extorting a sign of feeling. In this
		way, and others even more conclusive, I have demonstrated the
		good faith of my class.</p>

		<p>“I have given several receptions for the entertainment of my
		friends, and record here some results for the benefit of those in other
		cities who choose to try similar experiments.</p>

		<p>“The available class now consists of eight—four gentlemen and
		four ladies, from seventeen to forty years of age. Two of these
		(both ladies) I have never been able to take into the region of hallucinations.
		I can control them physically, can prevent their unclasping
		their hands, or laying down a fan, or rising from their chairs, or
		pronouncing their own names; but here my influence stops. I cannot
		make them think that the room is hot or cold, or that mosquitoes
		are prevalent, or disturb the testimony of their senses in any way.</p>

		<p>“The other six are lost to the realities of life the instant I touch
		them. One of them I can put into a sound sleep in a second, and
		he will sleep until I awaken him.</p>

		<p>“It should be stated here that these sensitives are above the average
		of intelligence and mental activity. Three of them are clerks
		in the departments, one, who took the valedictory in college, being
		an artist in the Smithsonian. Two are in business for themselves;
		one of them, a shrewd, sagacious and level-headed man as one would
		meet anywhere, with a sharp commercial turn of mind. This man
		differs from the others in being keenly incredulous—sceptical of
		his hallucinations when they seem unreasonable.</p>

		<p>“For instance, at a reception the other evening, at which the members
		of the Cabinet were present with their families, I introduced to
		my sensitives a learned pig.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>“‘See here!’ I said, when they were all in the mesmeric trance;
		‘here you are in my dime museum. Let me show you my educated
		pig.’</p>

		<p>“They all wanted to see it, and I whistled, snapped my fingers,
		and called their attention to the fine animal before them. They
		evidently saw it.</p>

		<p>“‘A lovely little white pig!’ said a young lady.</p>

		<p>“‘Only it isn’t little and it isn’t white,’ said the silversmith; ‘it
		is a big black fellow,’ and he appealed to the others.</p>

		<p>“I explained that it was a scarlet pig, and told them it could read
		and sing.</p>

		<p>“‘Sing! Oh yes, we hear you!’ said the incredulous man sarcastically.</p>

		<p>“I snapped my fingers. ‘There he goes!’ said the artist,
		‘singing ‘Wait till the Clouds Roll By.’’</p>

		<p>“‘I hear singing,’ said Incredulous, turning to me. ‘‘Titwillow,’
		isn’t it? How do you work him—the machinery, I mean?’</p>

		<p>“The others laughed at him. ‘Why, the pig sings,’ said the
		young lady; ‘can’t you hear him sing? can’t you see him sing?’</p>

		<p>“‘He looks as if he sang. I see his jaws move, and he sounds as if
		he sang,’ persisted Incredulous; ‘but he doesn’t sing. Pigs don’t sing.’</p>

		<p>“‘Very well, what is it, then?’ asked one of the clerks, triumphantly.</p>

		<p>“‘A tube and a hole in the floor, may be; it’s well done, though,’
		said the doubter.</p>

		<p>“‘Suppose you go and find the tube,’ suggested the artist.</p>

		<p>“He went and kicked around where he supposed it to be, tore up
		a piece of the carpet and looked nonplussed.</p>

		<p>“‘Yonder’s the pig over by the entrance, singing ‘A Warrior
		Bold,’’ said the artist, amid laughter.</p>

		<p>“The scoffer came back to his seat and said,</p>

		<p>“‘It’s probably ventriloquism.’</p>

		<p>“‘Aw!’ said the silversmith derisively, ‘you can’t throw the
		voice any such distance nor make it sound clear and sweet like
		that. I’ve made a study of ventriloquism.’</p>

		<p>“‘Well, I’ve made a study of pig,’ said Incredulous obstinately.</p>

		<p>“Then I changed the illusion by making the pig’s ear grow out
		three feet long, and then turning him into an elephant with one leg
		and four tails.</p>

		<p>“Sometimes I turn my class into infants and have them ‘play
		school,’ with infinite fun; sometimes I transport them over the seas
		to Africa or Japan on my enchanted carpet, where for a brief space
		they enjoy all the delights of travel; sometimes we participate in battles,
		sometimes visit famous picture galleries, sometimes the artist
		enjoys a quiet talk with Socrates, or Moses or Confucius, providing
		both questions and answers in a curious dual action of the mind
		highly entertaining to the audience.</p>

		<p>“The other evening I transformed my artist into President Cleveland.
		He assumed the character with quiet dignity, but said he had
		had a hard day’s work and was tired.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>“‘Queen Victoria will visit you this evening, you know,’ I said.</p>

		<p>“‘No!’ he exclaimed with surprise. ‘I didn’t know she was in
		this country. When did she come?’</p>

		<p>“‘Yesterday, on the Aurania; here she comes, now.’</p>

		<p>“He straightened up as I spoke and received her imaginary Majesty
		with real dignity and tact. After bowing and shaking hands he
		said:</p>

		<p>“‘I have heard with unfeigned pleasure of your Majesty’s approach
		to the capital of the republic, and it is my agreeable privilege to extend
		to you the freedom of this city and country in behalf of sixty
		millions of people. Dan, get the lady a chair!’</p>

		<p>“As she seemed to seat herself he listened a moment, smiled and
		said: ‘I reciprocate those feelings, as do all Americans, and I trust
		that the amicable relations so long preserved between this republic
		and the mighty realm of which you are the honored and beloved
		ruler may never be broken.’</p>

		<p>“‘Where can the lady hang her crown?’ I asked him. ‘It must
		have a peck of diamonds in it. Can’t I take it?’</p>

		<p>“He looked scornfully at me and I added: ‘Can’t the boys manage
		to get it away from her Majesty when she goes down stairs?’</p>

		<p>“‘You are a disgrace to this administration, Dan, and have got to
		be fired out!’ the President exclaimed angrily to me, and then he
		humbly apologized to the Queen.</p>

		<p>“He casually added that the fisheries dispute might lead to trouble,
		and she would be prudent to let our boys get bait along shore where
		it seemed handiest.</p>

		<p>“I know of no other thing in which there is so much entertainment
		as mesmerism. For the benefit of those who desire to experiment
		I append certain conclusions from my own experiments
		here:</p>

		<p>“1. About one person in ten can be mesmerized.</p>

		<p>“2. The proportion of people who have the ‘power’ to mesmerize,
		if it be a power, I do not know.</p>

		<p>“3. Mesmerism is a trance and seems to me almost identical with
		somnambulism.</p>

		<p>“4. It is as harmless as sleep. My sensitives occasionally come to
		me in the daytime to be put to sleep for the purpose of obtaining
		rest.</p>

		<p>“5. Hallucinations that take place under mesmerism are seldom
		remembered in a subsequent waking state, but are generally recalled
		with vividness in a subsequent mesmeric state.</p>

		<p>“6. Mesmerized subjects do not see the objects or people in the
		room, or hear any noise whatever except the voice of the operator.</p>

		<p>“7. My sensitives could have an arm or a leg amputated, I have
		no doubt, without suffering any pain.</p>

		<p>“8. Some of my sensitives are able to tell what goes on behind
		them and where they cannot see it, by some occult sense of which I
		am ignorant. I am at present pursuing study along this line.</p>

		<p>“Others here are now experimenting, and I think mesmerism is
		the coming fashionable ‘fad.’</p>

		scientists were to investigate this much abused subject (as all of
		them might) they would soon find themselves <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</em> in
		relation to their premises that all manifestations of mind are nothing
		but products of matter. Huxley, for instance, that the “mind is a
		voltaic pile giving shocks of thought,” and many other quotations
		equally as absurd by other materialistic philosophers (?) who claim
		prominence as such.</p>

		<p>As long ago as 1843 I was induced to investigate and try this
		phenomenon mainly for a hygienic purpose and afterwards led on by
		curiosity. I had no teacher, consulted no works on the subject, but
		derived all I learned in relation thereto by my own individual experiments,
		and in parenthesis say that what I learned I hold as above all
		price in settling in my mind the vexed question, “to be or not to be.”</p>

		<p>In 1847 I was in Wisconsin, and for the satisfaction of others I
		was induced to a renewal of experiments in magnetism. I was
		located with several other families with a view of forming a co-operative
		colony, so that excepting myself the rest had their
		residences closely together, whilst mine was half a mile from the
		rest. The subject at one time was brought up for discussion, and an
		earnest desire on the part of many to see something of it resulted in
		my finding a subject to experiment with at once, and fortunately he
		proved to be an extraordinary one. The finding of property through
		him in a mesmeric condition was a thing of common occurrence, and
		in some instances he seemed to be conscious of the mental conditions
		under which the property was lost. I found that he could take
		cognizance of what was occurring out of his sight, by pre-arrangements
		to test him.</p>

		<p>One evening I mesmerized him, and in imagination took him to
		England, and prepared as I was to accept the marvellous, I was considerably
		surprised at the probabilities of some statements from a
		letter received afterwards. Telling of this to my neighbors, they
		suggested the institution of a series of experiments to thoroughly
		test the matter. The course pursued was this: His brother would
		magnetize him, distant from me one-half a mile, and in the evening,
		according to arrangements, my family were to be engaged at anything
		suggested to our minds at the time, something for instance
		somewhat out of the ordinary routine of family occupation, to make
		it more apparent, and by comparing notes it was evident that through
		some mysterious law or power of mind he was with us taking
		cognizance of our actions. This was so thoroughly demonstrated
		that the parties concerned would have subscribed and sworn to the
		same before any officer qualified to administer an oath.—<cite class="name">A. Lansdell</cite>,

	<h2 class="title">The Ancient Iberians.</h2>

	<p class="subtitle">THEIR STATION IN CANADA DESCRIBED BY THE REV. W. H. H.
	MURRAY.—A PSYCHOMETRIC REPORT ON AN ANCIENT RACE.</p>

	<p>The Rev. W. H. H. Murray, the eloquent minister who was once
	so conspicuous in Boston, on a yacht excursion to Canada recently
	wrote from Tadousac to the <em>Boston Herald</em> as follows:</p>

	<p>“At that point of time touched by the earliest ray of historic
	knowledge, the eye of the student of human annals sees, occupying
	the Spanish peninsula, a race of men called Iberians. These old
	Iberians were not a tribe or clan, but a people, numerous and potential,
	with a fully developed and virile language, skilled in arms and
	the working of precious metals, and industriously commercial. This
	much can be clearly inferred from the extent of their territory and
	the remnant of them, with their characteristics and habits, which
	still remain. This old people, themselves a colony from some other
	country, once existent and highly civilized in the remote past, spread
	from the Mediterranean Sea to the slopes of the Pyrenees, and all
	over southern Gaul as far as the Rhone, and flowed westward with
	a movement so forceful that it included all the British Islands. All
	this happened 4000 to 5000 B. C. They are older than the Egyptians
	probably by 1000 years, and were strong enough to attempt the
	conquest of the known world.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>“These Iberians colonized Sicily. They were the original settlers
	in Italy and pushed their way northward as far as Norway and
	Sweden, where can still be found among the present inhabitants
	their physical characteristics—dark skin and jet black hair. This
	ancient people were not barbarians, but highly civilized. They had
	the art of writing and a literature. Poetry was cultivated. Their
	laws were set in verse; and for these laws thus written they claimed
	an antiquity of 6000 years.</p>

	<p>“This ancient race has passed away, as all great races do. The
	rise and decline of a people are as a day. They have a sunrise, a
	noon, a sunset, and there remains of them and their splendor nothing
	but a gloaming, a twilight of a thousand years, perhaps, and after
	that</p>

	<p class="subtitle">OBLIVION’S STARLESS NIGHT.</p>

	<p>“This old Iberian, world-conquering race came to its sunset hour
	a thousand years ago, and the gloaming after their sunset is deepening
	into that gloom which hides all. Only a remnant, a hint of the
	old-time radiance, remains up to this day.</p>

	<p>“In Southern Europe, the remnant of this antique race, the fragment
	of a root with the old-time vigorous sap in it, may still be
	found. There, on the Spanish peninsula where its cradle was rocked,
	the grave of a once powerful race is being slowly sodded; for there
	still live that strange people called the Basques. It matters not today
	what they are—chiefly mountaineers, I think—but they are of
	the old Iberian stock, and the Iberians were colonists from some
	unknown land, pre-historic, undiscoverable by us. Colonists and
	colonizers also. From some unknown land, hidden from us in the
	gloom of ages, these Iberians came to Southern Europe in ships. To
	Sicily they went in ships; to Britain and Ireland; to Norway also,
	and where else, or how far or for what, is left to conjecture. But
	being strong in numbers, ambitious to conquer, skilled in navigation,
	we can well believe that they pushed their flag and commerce nigh
	to the ends of the world.</p>

	<p>“Now these Basques, to-day mountaineers, they tell me, were
	once, nor long ago, great sailors. In instinct and habit, they were
	true to the old Iberian stock, to which they were as the last green
	leaf on a dying tree. They were of a world-conquering race, and
	they sailed the seas of the world, seeking profit fearlessly. Four
	hundred years ago Jacques Cartier, himself a Breton, with the old
	Basque or Iberian blood warm in him—for the Bretons were of the
	old Iberian stock, with the same temper and look of face—sailed
	into the gulf of the St. Lawrence, and found—what?</p>

	<p class="subtitle">THE BASQUES BEFORE HIM.</p>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">Not one Basque ship, but many. Engaged in what? In hunting
	whales. Whalers they were, and whalers they had been in these
	parts for years and centuries.</p>

	<p>“How know I this? Because—the records are scanty, and pity it
	is that they are not fuller—Cartier himself, and other of the old
	navigators to these waters, found not only the Basque whaling ships
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>before them, but the nomenclature of all the shores and of the fish
	in the waters purely Basque. Bucalaos is the Basque name for codfish,
	and the Basques called the whole coast Bucalaos land, or codfish
	land, because of the multitudes of codfish along the coast. And up
	to this day, underlying the thin veneer of saint this and saint that,
	which superstitious piety has given to every bay and cape and natural
	object in gulf and on river, you find the old Basque names of
	places and things—the solid oak beneath the tawdry coating applied
	by priestly brush for churchly purposes. There is Basque harbor,
	Basque island, and old Basque fort, and a place known as the
	spot where these old-time whalers boiled their blubber and cured
	their catch of fish. It was from these old Basque whalers, whose
	fathers and forefathers for a thousand or thousands of years had visited
	this coast in commerce, and who knew every cape, bay, island,
	shoal, and harbor from the Bay of Fundy to Cape Tourmente, as
	well as from the old Icelandic pilots, that Columbus learned of the
	existence of this Western Continent; and when he sailed from Lisbon
	on his ‘world-seeking voyage,’ I make no doubt that he as
	surely knew, by actual information, of America, as I know that the
	island of Anticosti is but 200 miles below me. And yet I read in a
	paper somewhere lately that some wise dunce had proposed to ‘celebrate
	the fourth centennial of the discovery of America by Columbus’!
	That’s rich!</p>

	<p>“To-night the yacht Champlain is swinging at anchor in the harbor
	of Tadousac, and I am writing in her little cabin with a profound
	conviction that, a thousand years</p>

	<p class="subtitle">BEFORE COLUMBUS WAS BORN,</p>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">a little group of men, Basques by name, then living in southern
	Europe, a remnant of the old Iberian race, anchored their ships in
	the same harbor in the month of August annually. Only half a
	mile to the west of me, the Saguenay, whose bottom is one hundred
	fathoms deeper down than the bed of the St. Lawrence, pours its
	gloomy current between the stupendous cliffs of rock which make
	for its resistless passage an awful portal. These monstrous cliffs of
	bare, gray rock have not changed in form or color or appearance
	since some force, next to that of the Almighty, lifted them from the
	under world and placed them to stand eternal sentinels at the entrance
	to this strange, impressive, awe-inspiring river—for the wind
	and wear of unnumbered centuries have left them cold and bare,
	soilless and treeless, save where some stunted shrub, with a single
	root, has spiked itself into a crevice, and there stands starved and
	dying, as it lives its withered life.</p>

	<p>“As it is to-night to eye and ear, so was it centuries ago; and so
	the old Basque whalers saw it while yet the great continent to the
	west was a trackless wilderness from ocean to ocean and gulf to gulf.
	And Columbus and Jacques Cartier and Champlain were not, by five
	hundred years, yet born.</p>

	<p>“The harbor of Tadousac is a basin shaped like a sickle. On the
	west the mountain wall of the Saguenay protects it. The eastern
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>curve is sheltered by vast sand lanes, scoured from the sea bottom
	and whirled upward by some mighty eddy in geologic ages. To the
	north are mountains of stone, their gray surface flecked here and
	there by stunted fir and cedar or dwarfed birches. Between these
	mountains of rock and the water of the harbor or basin is a short,
	narrow plateau, lifted some fifty feet above the water line, every foot
	of which is historic to a degree. On no other bit of ground of equal
	size on the American continent has so much been done and suffered
	which can interest the curious, touch the sensibilities, or kindle the
	imagination and fan it into flame.</p>

	<p>There is reason to think that before the Christ was born the old
	Iberian ships were here; and their descendants, the Basques, continued
	the commerce which their progenitors had established and
	which rendezvoused here 1,500 years after the Galilean name had
	conquered kingdoms and empires. The Norsemen were here, we
	know, a thousand years ago, and many a night the old sea kings of
	the north drank out of their mighty drinking horns good health to
	distant ones and honors to Thor and Odin. Then, late enough
	to have his coming known to letters, and hence recorded, Jacques
	Cartier came, himself a Breton, and hence cousin in blood to the
	Basque whalers, whom he found here engaged in a pursuit which
	their race had followed before Rome was founded or Greece was
	born, before Jerusalem was builded, or even Egypt, perhaps, planted
	as a colony. St. Augustine, Plymouth rock, Quebec—these are
	mushroom growths, creations of yesterday, traditionless, without a
	legend and without a fame, beside this harbor of Tadousac, whose
	history, along a thin but strong cord of sequence, can be traced
	backward for a thousand years, and whose connection with Europe
	is older than the name!</p>

	<div class="subsection">
		<h3>PSYCHOMETRY AND ARCHAEOLOGY.</h3>

		<p>Whether “the thin but strong cord” by which Mr. Murray pulls
		the old Iberians to these shores be mainly historical or imaginative,
		I have not attempted to decide; but as to the old races of Southern
		Europe there are relics already sufficient to evoke their history by
		psychometric exploration.</p>

		<p>The <cite>Popular Science News</cite> of Boston gives a sketch of some old
		relics from “La Nature” which I quote as follows:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>“Recent explorations in Spain by two Belgian scientists, the
			Messrs. Siret, have resulted in some very interesting discoveries.
			Relics of a prehistoric race have been found in great abundance,
			ranging from the stone age to that of bronze and metals. These people
			buried their dead not only in stone graves or cells, but also in
			great jars of burnt clay, accompanied by pieces of pottery and other
			articles of use and value. This form of jar-burial is very widespread,
			and examples have been found from Japan to Peru. These relics
			are supposed to belong to that ancient race which lived in Europe
			previous to the Aryan immigration, the various branches of which
			are known as Iberians, Pelasgians, Ligurians, etc., according to the
			country in which they lived.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>“Several skeletons were found adorned with silver and gold ornaments.
			One of the most remarkable is illustrated here. It is a
			female skull encircled by a band of silver, to which is attached a
			thin plate of the same metal. It is not known whether it was originally
			worn in the position as when found, or, as is most likely, had
			been accidentally displaced after burial. This skull was found in a
			cave near the station of Fuente-Alamo, where gold and silver are
			found in small quantities in the soil; and it is quite possible that in
			those ancient times the mining of the precious metals was a regular
			occupation of the inhabitants.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<div class="image">
			<a href="images/illo1.jpg"><img src="images/illo1-th.jpg" width="316" height="306" alt="The skull described above." /></a>
		</div>

		<p><strong class="headline">Psychometric Description.</strong>—Mrs. Buchanan, describing the
		subject from this engraving, without seeing it or knowing what it represented,
		spoke as follows:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>“This is far away; it is remains of some kind; remains of a human
			being, of a very remote type of female. Her surroundings
			were very rude. She was of a race of strong animal instincts—a
			large people. She seems something like a squaw. (What of their
			habitations?) They were very rude, as much like caves as anything.
			I think they lived in caves and rocks. They hunted and fished.
			Their weapons were of stones, but they had some kind of metal
			which they could hammer out. They dried their food in the sun—fishes
			and meats. They had very little agriculture. They had a
			process for making things they wanted for domestic use, and for
			weapons, as well as stone implements. They may have used the
			precious metals, not as money but for ornaments. It was not a numerous
			race, did not propagate fast. They have all died out. There
			is no vestige of them on the earth. They were a brown, dark colored
			race. Their heads were low and faces large; jaws prominent.”</p>

		<p>Evidently this is not the race of which Mr. Murray speaks—neither
		Iberian nor Basque.</p>

<div id="art5" class="article">
	<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>The Star-dust of the Universe.</h2>

	<p>The distinguished astronomer, Norman Lockyer, has lately read a
	paper before the Royal Society (London) under the title of a “Preliminary
	Note on the Spectra of the Meteorites,” which advances
	some of the boldest theories and suggestions ever offered concerning
	the Universe, which cannot fail to interest the readers of the <cite class="name">Journal
	of Man</cite>.</p>

	<p>According to Mr. Lockyer the meteors which we have been accustomed
	to consider trivial or incidental matters in planetary and stellar
	systems, no more important than the dust which the housewife raises
	from parlor and chamber, are really fundamental and basic elements
	of the Universe, capable of generating comets, planets, suns and stars.</p>

	<p>If this idea can be entertained, meteors must be vastly more numerous
	than the world has supposed. Cosmical space, according to Mr.
	Lockyer, is filled with meteorites of various sizes, flying in many
	directions with enormous velocities and moving in certain orbits like
	larger bodies. Many observations have been made to determine the
	number of these meteorites. Dr. Schmidt, of Athens, in seventeen
	years of observation concluded that in a clear dark night an observer
	would see on an average fourteen an hour at one station. Other
	astronomers have calculated that if observations were made over the
	whole earth, ten thousand times as many would be seen as could be
	seen by a single observer. Calculating thus, it has been inferred
	that about 20,000,000 luminous meteors fall on the earth every twenty-four
	hours, besides the innumerable amount of minute bodies too small
	to be seen by telescopes—which some suppose to be twenty times as
	numerous as the visible.</p>

	<p>Prof. H. A. Newton makes some astounding estimates on this subject—that
	the orbit of the earth is filled with meteorites, about 250
	miles apart, making a group of about 30,000 in a space equal to that
	of the earth. If such calculations are reliable, the query must arise,
	How much effect can such a meteoric shower every day in the year
	exert on the orbital motion of the earth, in retarding its velocity?
	The effect must be greatly increased if, according to Prof. Newton,
	the velocity of meteors striking the earth is about thirty miles a
	second, varying from ten to forty.</p>

	<p>From such a basis as this rises the grand hypothesis of Mr. Lockyer,
	who is a courageous theorist, that all cosmic space is filled with
	meteorites, that they go in swarms, and that not only comets but
	stars are formed by conglomerate aggregations of meteorites.</p>

	<p>Schiaparelli, in 1866, demonstrated that the orbit of the August
	meteors was the same as that of the comet of that year. It is in
	August and November of each year that we have the most brilliant
	display of meteors in two distinct groups, or orbits. Those of August
	come from a point in the constellation of Perseus and those in
	November from a point in the constellation Leo. They are believed
	to fill two distinct orbits or rings making an elliptical orbit round
	the sun. In such orbits, comets are believed by astronomers to be
	formed by a concentrated swarm of incandescent meteorites rendered
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>luminous by collisions. But this hypothesis of innumerable collisions
	between meteorites travelling in the same orbits does not appear
	very plausible.</p>

	<p>This doctrine of the genesis of comets, advanced by Schiaparelli,
	is extended by Mr. Lockyer to the genesis of all great luminous
	bodies. Nebulæ, comets, stars, variable and temporary stars, are
	all thus brought under a general law and method of genesis. The
	increasing approximation and condensation of the meteorites is
	seen in different classes of stars. Stars of the class iii.a are not so
	far advanced as others.</p>

	<p>The next step in the hypothesis is that in the extreme approximation
	and condensation of the meteorites a degree of heat is generated
	which converts the whole into a mass of incandescent vapor, at
	a “transcendental temperature.” The maximum temperature being
	thus attained, a cooling process begins, which is seen in our sun and
	other stars of the second class. Other stars, according to Mr.
	Lockyer, of class iii.b exhibit spectra which show that their temperature
	is not so high, and the last stage is attained by stars and other
	bodies which have ceased to be luminous, and, therefore, are not
	seen, but may be recognized by the perturbations which they produce
	in the movements of other bodies.</p>

	<p>According to this hypothesis our solar system was once but a
	mighty swarm of meteorites, extending as far as the farthest planet
	at present. We may as well suppose its materials to have been a
	swarm of meteorites as to suppose a chaotic fire-mist. Mr. Lockyer
	supposes the clash of meteor swarms to have produced new stars, and
	suggests the possibility of stellar or planetary bodies coming into
	collision, though no observations ever made yet give an example.</p>

	<p>The destroyed planet, Sideros, discovered by Prof. Denton, illustrates
	that the universe has its disorder and tragedy as well as our
	own sphere. The time is coming when all these mysteries are to be
	cleared up—it will be when Psychometry is added to our telescopic
	and spectroscopic methods. Then will astronomy and all other
	sciences receive their grandest enlargement. In this task I cannot at
	present engage, for the limitless field of Anthropology alone is too
	much for a solitary scientist laboring for the advent of “<strong class="emphasis">The New
	Civilization</strong>.”</p>

	<div id="misc1" class="miscellany_item">
		<p><strong class="headline">Bright Literature.</strong>—New publications have just been received
		which express the bright mental activity of the present time. The
		first number of <cite>The New Christianity</cite>, which has just appeared, bears
		the editorial names of B. F. Barrett and S. H. Spencer, and is issued
		by the Swedenborg Publishing Association, Philadelphia, published
		every Thursday in sixteen large pages, at $2 per annum. At so
		moderate a price it should have a large circulation. The name of
		Rev. B. F. <strong class="name">Barrett</strong> is a sufficient guarantee of the literary excellence,
		profound thought and liberal aims of this weekly. The Association,
		of which Mr. Barrett is president, holds “the good of life to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>be paramount to the truth of doctrine; charity superior to faith;
		doctrine (though it be from the Lord out of heaven) to be of no
		value save as a <em>means</em> to this divine end—purity of heart and righteousness
		of life.” Hence, they have been more intent on diffusing
		their principles than building up a religious establishment. The
		Association has condensed Swedenborg’s writings into ten small volumes,
		in about one-tenth of the compass of the unabridged works,
		and has sold about 37,000 volumes, besides many thousands given
		away.</p>

		<p>The Boston <cite>Herald</cite> says of this publication that it “deserves a
		cordial welcome as an attempt to express, through the religious
		press, a wider interest in the things of this world than most of the
		New Church papers have aimed at, … a broader treatment of
		what concerns our common Christianity than has been heretofore
		attempted in this religious connection, and thus satisfy the New
		Church people, who realize that they are still in the world, as well
		as the no-church people, who prefer smaller doses from the abstract
		writings of Swedenborg, and more of the thought of New Churchmen
		about what all men are thinking of.”</p>

	<div id="misc2" class="miscellany_item">
		<p><strong class="headline">The Two Worlds</strong>, published weekly, at 61 George Street,
		Chatham Hill, Manchester, England, at 2d. a number, 2s., 2d. for
		thirteen weeks, or 8s., 8d. per annum in advance, is under the editorial
		control of <em>Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten</em> and <em>E. M. Wallis</em>. The
		first number is dated Nov. 18, 1887. The names of its editors are a
		sufficient guarantee of its ability and its noble aims. They are
		admired and honored in America as well as Europe, and have thousands
		of friends. The first number fully sustains the expectations
		raised by their names. There is a brightness, vigor, independence
		and eloquence in the editorials which are refreshing. The salutatory
		says: “We do not propose to inflict on readers searching for light
		from the higher world matter <em>beneath</em> instead of beyond the reader’s
		previous status of thought and education. The spiritual rostrum
		should be the sphere of instruction alike to listener and reader,—not
		the school in which unfledged and half-developed mediums seek
		to entertain their audiences by practicing the A B C of the oratorical
		art.”</p>

		<p>They say, also, “That the scope of this journal may not be misunderstood,
		we desire to state at once, and in advance of our future
		issues, that we propose to traverse, as far as possible, the wide and
		varied fields of human interests that might be vitalized and exalted
		by that knowledge of the life hereafter, which spirits alone can
		demonstrate. Instead of confining ourselves, therefore, to the
		relation of phenomenal facts and speculative philosophy, we shall
		endeavor to show how beneficially the spiritualistic revelations of the
		nineteenth century might operate through such departments of earth
		life as reform, science, theology, politics, occultism and the only true
		and practical religion, viz.: goodness and truth in the life here as a
		preparation for heaven and happiness in the life hereafter.” As to
		Occultism and Theosophy, they say: “Every article that will appear
		in these columns will be written by <em>one who knows</em>, and who will
		<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>deal with those subjects from the standpoint of practical experience.”
		The article on this subject in the first number is extremely
		interesting and instructive, in fact, the first clear and satisfactory
		statement that has been published. Among other facts it mentions
		that “Lord Lytton, the Earl of Stanhope, and Lieut. Morrison (better
		known as Zadkiel), and the author of Art Magic, belonged to this
		society,”—a secret Occult society in England, successor to the
		ancient societies of Egypt, Greece and India.</p>

		<p>There is no reason to doubt that the <cite>Two Worlds</cite> will have a brilliant
		career, and do much to elevate the tone and enhance the reputation
		of spiritual science. The inspiration of Emma Hardinge
		Britten is of a high order, and flows into a mind which has also
		a strong grasp on external life. Either on the rostrum or through
		the press she is a distinguished leader in the spiritual movement.
		Mr. Wallis has also earned a high rank as an exponent of Spiritualism
		on its highest ethical plane.</p>

		Dr. E. B. Foote is one of the most conspicuous and worthy of
		America’s medical reformers. His “Plain Home Talk,” when first
		issued on a smaller scale as “Medical Common Sense,” sold to the
		amount of 250,000 copies, now under the title of “Plain Home
		Talk,” containing 935 pages, with 200 illustrations, the publishing
		company say that they issue 2000 or more copies every month. Its
		vast circulation is not surprising when we consider that it is almost
		a cyclopedia of medical information for the people at the amazingly
		low price of $1.50. Copies of this valuable work may be obtained
		from the editor of the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>, or from Dr. E. B. Foote,

		<p><strong class="headline">Psychic Theories.</strong>—An esteemed correspondent says, “I trust
		you will soon have space and time in which to fully discuss theosophy,
		and its bold assertion that Spiritualism is but the manifestation
		of dangerous elementals or of the souls of those sent untimely
		from this life as suicides and executed criminals, who until their selfish
		desires are gratified, make use of ‘astral shells’ of the real
		spirits of our dead friends, in order to wickedly deceive us, a discouraging
		view.” Theosophy or divine wisdom does not make such
		assertions. They are but traditional dogmas which did not
		originate in scientific investigation. Those who make such assertions
		may call themselves theosophists, but they have no exclusive
		right to such a name, which belongs to all seekers of divine wisdom.
		American theosophy as represented by the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>
		makes no such assertions, and relies upon investigation, never receiving
		the speculative notions of darker ages without evidence, whether
		they relate to Metempsychosis, or the garden of Eden, the burning
		hell, the purgatory, or the various pictures of the infernal
		<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>and supernal regions which had been current in the old world before
		such realms were ever investigated.</p>

		<p>When my readers hear any such theories advanced, let them
		quietly ask for the evidence, <em>what are the facts</em> on which such opinions
		are based, when were they discovered, who were the investigators,
		and what was their method of investigation? If such questions
		cannot be answered, the theories deserve little attention.</p>

		meets no resistance has the velocity of 192,924 miles a second.
		The velocity of an electric current sent through iron wire is 62,100

		<p><strong class="headline">Obstreperous and Pragmatic Vulgarity.</strong>—The house of
		Knoedler &amp; Co., leading art dealers in New York, has been arrested
		by Comstock for selling photographs of celebrated paintings from
		the art galleries of Paris. It is a foul mind which sees obscenity in
		that which cultivated people admire, and the Hoboken Evening
		News says very appropriately, “Of all the cranky Pharisees allowed
		to run at large, Anthony Comstock is the chief. He is a most unmitigated
		nuisance and requires most emphatic and summary suppression.”</p>

		<p>The N. Y. <cite>Home Journal</cite>, in a well considered editorial, says:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>“The need of a revision of the law regarding immoral publications
			in literature and art becomes every day more manifest. There is required
			especially a precise definition of what the statute is designed
			to prohibit. At present there is no uniform criterion. It is just
			what the local Dogberry and the scratch jury happen to find. Books
			that have had an established place in literature for generations and
			are found in all the great libraries of the world; pictures that represent
			the highest skill attained in the leading schools of Europe; reproductions
			of works that adorn the national and royal galleries
			cherished as monuments of genius to reflect the glory of the time,—these
			are quite likely to be brought up and solemnly condemned by
			our tribunals as unfit for the contemplation of our superior American
			virtue. But the real injustice of the proceeding follows in the infliction
			of fines or imprisonment on the unsuspecting vendors of the
			works, who naturally imagine that merchandise current in all the
			other markets of the civilized world would be current also here. The
			most respectable houses, known throughout the length and breadth
			of the country for their honorable dealings, are exposed to legal prosecution
			any moment that an officious fanatic or jealous rival pleases
			to bring a charge that certain works in their store have an immoral
			tendency.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Judge Brady, of the Supreme Court, says, “If I had been a legislator
		I would never have voted for this law…. It is evident that
		mere nudity in painting and sculpture is not obscenity. It is a false
		delicacy and mere prudery which would condemn and banish from
		sight all such objects.” Public opinion should be directed against
		the vice society which employs and pays such a tool as Comstock.
		The prosecution which he instigated against Mrs. Elmina Slenker, of
		Virginia, resulted in her acquittal.</p>

		<p>The <cite>N. Y. Evening Post</cite> says, “If there is to be a prosecution in

		<p><strong class="headline">Hygiene.</strong>—Sir Spencer Wells, in an address to the Medico-Chirurgical
		Society of Nottingham, England, referred to sanitary
		<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>improvements which had reduced the annual death rate from
		twenty-nine in a thousand to nineteen, and said that it ought to be
		reduced to fifteen or twelve. He then said, “And if we have—as we
		really have—seen the average duration of human life in Great
		Britain advance from thirty years (which it was half a century ago)
		to forty-nine years (which it is now, according to life tables), why
		may we not witness a still further advance? Why should seventy
		or eighty years remain as the usual limit of human life? Why
		should its natural duration under perfectly healthy surrounding conditions
		not be at least 100 years, with an occasional extension of
		some ten or fifteen years more?”</p>

		<p>“When people are made to understand that at least nine-tenths of
		the deaths in England are premature, the representatives of the most
		parsimonious rate payers will be compelled by the criticism of the
		public to remember that they also represent the more sacred interests
		of human life and happiness, and that resistance to sanitary improvements
		is punished by preventable disease and premature death.
		High local mortality is largely due to want of local information.
		For the tens or hundreds who are killed by murder or manslaughter,
		or by accident, or in battles on land or sea, thousands and millions
		are victims of preventable disease. When this is fully understood,
		no imperial Government, no local authority, will dare to incur the
		responsibility of such a national disgrace.”</p>

		<p>Dr. Wells then forcibly illustrated the dangerous and pestilential
		results of our system of burying the dead, planting the germs of diseases
		in the ground to come forth again, and corrupting the water
		supply. London alone uses 2,200 acres of land for cemeteries, and
		England and Wales have 11,000 cemeteries, costing for the land
		over $600 per acre, all dangerous to health, while about $25,000,000
		are annually expended on funerals. For all this cremation was the
		remedy.</p>

	<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>Chap. XI.—the Principal Methods of Studying the Brain.</h2>

	<p class="chapter_outline">Cranioscopy, Pathology, and Vivisection, their failures recognized—Limitations
	of Craniology and its stationary condition—Human
	Impressibility explained—Its prevalence in different climates—Method
	of testing it.</p>

	<p>In what manner shall we proceed to study the brain? All must
	admit the necessity of a thorough study of its anatomy; yet, unless
	we learn something of its functions, this anatomy is profitless and
	uninteresting; hence cerebral anatomy was crude and erroneous
	until, revolutionized by Gall and Spurzheim, it assumed a philosophical
	character and became connected with a doctrine of the
	cerebral functions.</p>

	<p>For the study of these functions three principal methods have
	been adopted by eminent scientists: 1st. The method of Cranioscopy,
	practiced by Gall and his followers. 2d. The study of
	Pathological Anatomy. 3d. The mutilation of the brains of living
	animals. But neither Cranioscopy, Pathology, nor Vivisection has
	given satisfactory demonstrations, nor does the whole scope of the
	alleged results of all embrace more than half of the cerebral
	functions.</p>

	<p>The results of Vivisection have been unsatisfactory. But it has
	shown that slicing away the anterior and upper parts of the brain of
	an animal produces a state of partial stupor—a loss of its intelligence
	and mental characteristics, without producing any great
	detriment to its muscular and physiological functions; while injuries
	inflicted upon the basilar parts of the brain produce evident derangements
	of muscular action, and are more dangerous to life. Vivisection
	has been almost entirely fruitless for the discovery of psychic
	functions, but in the hands of Prof. Ferrier and the continental vivisectors
	it has thrown much light upon cerebral psychology, and as I
	shall hereafter show, has confirmed my own discoveries.</p>

	<p>Pathological Anatomy, too, has been extremely unprofitable.
	“The results of Pathological Anatomy (says Muller) can, however,
	never have more than a limited application to the physiology of the
	brain. We are unacquainted with the laws according to which the
	different parts of the organ participate in the functions of each other,
	and we can only, in a general way, regard as certain that organic
	diseases in one part of the brain may induce changes in the function
	of other parts; but from these facts and the results of Pathological
	Anatomy, we cannot always draw certain conclusions.” Mr.
	Solly, after commenting on the general failure of Vivisection, remarks,
	“From pathology we might naturally expect surer evidence;
	but even here the physiologist who carefully examines its records is
	doomed to disappointment. As will be proved hereafter, no certain
	light has yet shone on physiology from this source.” Cerebral pathology
	will not continue to be so barren a study when we have a true
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>cerebral physiology to guide us. I find all pathological cases instructive
	as confirmations and illustrations of true cerebral science.</p>

	<p>The method of Dr. Gall—studying the growth and development
	of the different parts of the brain, as indicated by the cranium—is
	the most simple, rational and successful of all the methods adopted
	up to the present time. In his hands it has elicited a valuable and
	practical, though rude, system of phrenology. But Craniology or
	skull-study cannot perfect, nor can it positively demonstrate, the
	science.</p>

	<p>The observations of the craniologist are continually liable to
	error. The irregular thickness of the skull constitutes a great difficulty
	in the way of exact observations. By great expertness and
	accuracy of observation, he may overcome this difficulty in a great
	degree, but whenever the brain is subject to any remarkable influence,
	increasing or diminishing the activity and size of particular
	organs, the external form fails to indicate the internal condition,
	because it can change but slightly, and with slowness, after the skull
	is fully developed and ossified. Were the skull composed of more
	pliable materials, cranioscopy would be more accurate in its facts,
	but while it preserves a uniform exterior, the interior often undergoes
	remarkable changes. Convolutions that are frequently called
	into action become better supplied with arterial blood, expand and
	grow, while the adjacent portion of the inner plate of the skull
	becomes absorbed, and presents a remarkable indentation. Convolutions
	that are seldom in action shrink in size, and the adjacent bone
	grows in upon them. Thus the skull becomes thinner at the site of
	every active organ, and thicker over every convolution that is inactive.
	The translucency or opacity of the different parts of the skull,
	when a light is placed in its interior, generally indicates the active
	and inactive organs. Hence, many skulls of fine exterior reveal,
	upon interior examination, a degenerate character. Criminal heads
	generally present remarkable opacity and thickness in the region of
	the moral organs, with distinct digital impressions from the convolutions
	of the lower organs.</p>

	<p>Thus all craniological observations are liable to inaccuracy, even
	as regards development, and much more in regard to functional
	power. The activity, power and predominance of an organ may be
	essentially changed, without making any perceptible impression
	upon the interior of the skull, for an indefinite period. Changes in
	excitement and circulation, that revolutionize the character, may
	leave but a slight impression upon the interior, and none upon the
	exterior of the cranium. The external configuration of the skull is
	therefore not a true criterion of character when the influences of
	education, society, food, drink and disease have greatly changed the
	natural bias, although reliable in a strictly normal condition of brain
	and cranium.</p>

	<p>Organs which easily expand laterally by encroachment upon their
	neighbors, which is a common effect of local excitement, must be
	slow to make any impression upon the superjacent bone of the
	cranium. Cranioscopy, moreover, is incompetent to indicate the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>development of small regions or portions of a convolution; it gives
	but a rude survey of development. Being thus incapable of minuteness,
	accuracy and certainty, it cannot be considered a proper and
	sufficient basis for cerebral science. In the hands of Gall and
	Spurzheim, it had already very nearly attained its limits as regards
	the subdivision of organs, and the progress of their followers in
	discovery has been unimportant or fallacious.</p>

	<p>To what, then, can we resort, when the failures of Pathology and
	Vivisection are admitted, and we perceive the limited extent of the
	uncertain results of Craniology? Shall we not be compelled to
	resort to the same methods of investigation in the brain, which have
	been so successful in establishing the physiology of the nerves, viz.:
	direct experiment in exciting and arresting the action of the various
	masses of nervous fibre. Every sound physiologist must perceive
	that we are compelled to resort to experiment, or else to rest contented
	in ignorance of the true cerebral physiology. Muller, perceiving
	this, remarks, “The principle for the advancement of the
	physiology of the nerves then remains the same, viz.: experiment on
	the living nerves.”</p>

	<p>We therefore experiment on the living brain in that class of persons
	who are susceptible of being thus influenced; hence arises the
	last and most perfect method of cultivating Anthropology, by means
	of <span class="small_all_caps">HUMAN IMPRESSIBILITY</span>.</p>

	<p>Our system of Anthropology relies, for its demonstration, upon
	human impressibility. Impressibility in its general sense, or the
	power of being affected by external agents, is proportional to the
	development of life. Inorganic matter is affected only mechanically
	or chemically—vegetation is powerfully affected by causes
	which would have no perceptible influence on stones or metals,
	and animals are affected by remote objects, by sounds, by the voice,
	and by other influences which do not affect vegetables. Animals of
	a higher grade are affected by many moral influences which produce
	no effect on the inferior classes, and man, having the fullest development
	of all, is continually receiving a variety of influences from
	nature and society, to which animals are wholly insensible. As man
	is superior to animals in impressibility, so is the man of genius or
	the man of superior moral sentiments more easily affected by everything
	that addresses the intellect or the sentiments, than the ignorant
	and selfish classes of society. Superior impressibility is then the
	result of a superior development of the organs which feel the various
	impressions. In the highest order of genius capacities exist which recognize
	a thousand subtle influences and beauties in Nature of which
	common minds are unconscious, and the psychic influence of a human
	being is instantly and thoroughly recognized.</p>

	<p>For the purpose of analytical experiments upon the human functions,
	we require the development of a faculty which shall feel the
	influences we use. We look to the various forms of Sensibility.
	The organ of physical sensibility is situated in the temples, immediately
	over the cheek bone. It feels the influences of the various
	objects which affect the sense of feeling in all its modifications.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>Heat and cold, moisture and dryness, sound, light, and all the imponderable
	fluids produce their effects upon this region, and the more
	it is developed, the more powerfully are we affected by such
	agencies.</p>

	<p>The portion of Sensibility which feels the influences of the human
	nervaura, is the highest portion of the organ, where it connects with
	Modesty, Somnolence, and Ideality. This we regard as the special
	organ of Nervauric Impressibility, because it renders the system
	so sensitive to the nervaura, as to be strongly affected whenever it is
	applied.</p>

	<p>Mental impressibility is dependent upon intellectual organs, which
	feel the influences of mind. The power of recognizing mental
	action is dependent upon the internal part of the front lobe, located
	just above the root of the nose. This organ gives physiognomical
	talent, and a ready tact in appreciating the expression of mind
	through the eye, countenance, and gestures. It is a channel of mental
	sympathy, as displayed in the intercourse of society, and in the
	experiments of animal magnetism. By means of this organ, a general
	relation is established between the mind of the operator and that
	of the subject, which may exist without the capacity for local impressions,
	which would develop particular organs. It is devoted,
	however, to active perception rather than to passive impression. The
	faculty of being mentally impressed depends also upon the region of
	Spirituality and Marvellousness.</p>

	<p>Mental and nervous impressibility being dependent upon these
	organs, it follows that a large development of the front lobe favors
	Impressibility, and that the occipital organs tend to diminish it.
	Impressibility lies in a group of organs which sustain it, and may be
	expected to accompany its development. Sensibility, Somnolence,
	Dreaming, Ideality, Modesty, Humility, Organic Sensibility, Relaxation,
	etc., are its natural accompaniments; hence it will be found
	most abundantly in those classes of society which are most remarkable
	for refinement, sensitiveness, modesty, diffidence, humility, or
	submissiveness, disease, languor, debility, and intellectual excitement.
	Religious excitement, love, mirthfulness, thoughtfulness, imagination,
	benevolence, sympathy, sincerity, faith, philanthropy, hope, epicurism,
	intemperance, ardor, spirituality, effeminacy, imitation, romance
	and, in short, all amiable, sensitive, intellectual, refining, relaxing
	influences may be regarded as promotive of impressibility, and their
	opposites as calculated to destroy it.</p>

	<p>It is fortunate that disease promotes impressibility, for it enables
	the sick to be relieved by manipulation, and it causes medicines to
	operate more efficiently upon morbid constitutions or organs, which
	has been fully demonstrated by the Homœopathic School of therapeutics.
	But impressibility does not imply disease, although it may
	make the system more accessible to slight morbific agencies. We
	find individuals occasionally, of the highest tone of health and bodily
	vigor, who are highly impressible. Nor does it imply mental weakness,
	for it is highly congenial to intellectuality, and is occasionally
	found among the strongest and most cultivated minds. Nervous
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>Impressibility is that condition in which the nervaura has a powerful
	influence—in which the action of the brain and all the vital functions
	of the constitution may be controlled and indefinitely changed
	by the application of the hands of another individual—in which we
	are susceptible of being totally revolutionized in character by application
	of the fingers to the various organs, so as to become, for the
	time being, miserable or gay, philosophical, felonious, murderous,
	angry, stupid, insane, idiotic, drowsy, hot, cold, credulous, sceptical,
	timid, courageous, vain, indolent, sensual, hungry, diffident, haughty,
	avaricious, etc.; and in which the muscular strength, secretions, circulation,
	pulse, respiration, senses, and morbid or healthy conditions
	of the frame may be changed or controlled by the nervaura emitted
	from the hand of the operator acting upon the brain of the subject.</p>

	<p>The number of individuals who can be thus affected is different
	in different places. In southern climates they are more numerous
	than in northern—in the pleasant weather of summer more than
	in winter—in lecture rooms, ball rooms and places of fervid religious
	worship, more than in the street and market place, where the intellectual
	and moral faculties are less predominant. In the Southern
	States of the Union, thirty or forty per cent. of the population
	will give at once distinct evidence of impressibility. In the
	more northern, about ten per cent. will give indications of an influence
	from the hand. A moderate degree of impressibility which
	is almost universal in the South, belongs to more than half in the
	North.</p>

	<p>Impressible subjects may be selected by the development of the
	organs of Impressibility, and the general predominance of the frontal
	and coronal regions of the brain over the occipital. The qualities
	already mentioned as favoring impressibility may be studied in the
	character, or observed in the development, as they occupy the entire
	anterior half of the head, giving <em>breadth to the temples</em>, with
	height and projection to the forehead. An enlarged pupil of the
	eye will be one of the best symptoms, and, in connection with a calm,
	spiritual, gentle expression of countenance rarely fails to indicate
	impressibility.</p>

	<p>To test impressibility apply the fingers upon the organ of Somnolence,
	an inch horizontally behind the brow, with a very gentle
	contact; your subject, after a few minutes, will manifest a sensitiveness
	of the eye, and will wink oftener than usual—his winking
	will be repeated and prolonged, until his eyelids droop or remain
	closed—he is now somnolent and dreamy; and this condition may
	be prolonged until it becomes the Mesmeric Somnolence, or may
	be promptly removed by brushing the excitement off with the
	fingers.</p>

	<p>A very simple test of impressibility consists in passing the ends of
	the fingers over the palm of the hand of the subject, within one or more
	inches, and ascertaining whether he can recognize its passage by any
	impression. If impressible he will perceive a cooling sensation as the
	fingers pass. A more perfect demonstration is to let your subject
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>stand erect before you, and apply both hands gently over the forehead
	and moral organs, or upon the temples; then very slowly withdraw
	them, and continue this process until you perceive that as your hand
	is withdrawn, the head seems inclined to follow it as if attracted;
	some will move thus but an inch or two, others will be drawn forward
	and compelled to follow you wherever you go, or may be drawn
	down and prostrated upon the floor. You may accomplish the same
	upon the back of the head or body—the hand or any other part
	which is free to move; but the forehead is the best region, because
	the front lobe is the seat of Impressibility, and the operation cultivates
	that quality, by drawing excitement into the brain, and especially
	the front lobe, thus debilitating the muscular system and power
	of resistance.</p>

	<p>Apply the fingers upon the organ of Relaxation, below the cheek
	bone, and your subject, if standing, will become enfeebled, unsteady
	in attitude, and incapable of supporting as great weight as before in
	his extended hand. This will be counteracted by touching the
	region of Energy.</p>

	<p>The most painful experiments may be made by placing the hands
	upon the temples and face, so as to cover the regions of Sensibility,
	Disease, Relaxation, and Irritability—the effect of which would be
	to produce bodily weakness, sickness, pain, distress and general prostration;
	a condition, which if not relieved, might result in severe
	disease, but which may be counteracted by dispersing the excitement
	upward and backward, and by stimulating Health, Energy and
	Hardihood.</p>

	<p>By grasping a metallic rod firmly in the hand while the other end
	of it rests in the relaxed hand of an impressible person, you may
	transmit a current of nervaura, which he will recognize gradually
	entering his arm at the hand, passing slowly up to the shoulder, and
	then diffusing itself over the body.</p>

	<p>One may test his own impressibility by placing the palm of the
	hand in contact with any portion of the head or body of a vigorous
	constitution for about twenty minutes, and observing the different
	impressions imparted by different localities. If the hand be held in
	contact with an individual suffering from some active form of disease,
	resting upon the forehead or the pit of the stomach, the morbid symptoms
	will be very perceptibly transferred to any one of an impressible
	constitution; but I would not recommend the experiment to any
	but those who are embarrassed by a constitutional scepticism,
	which hinders their believing anything which is not impressed upon
	their own senses.</p>

	<p>An easy method of testing our susceptibility is by holding some
	active medicinal substance between the hands while sitting at ease
	(without knowing what the properties of the substance are), and
	holding other active substances at different times, to compare the
	effects which they produce upon the constitution. After such experiment,
	if the effects should in any case be greater than we desire, the
	influence should be removed by dispersive passes on the hands and
	down the arms.</p>

		<h3>MEDICAL ORTHODOXY</h3>

		<p>Is realizing the reaction of public opinion against
		all forms of monopoly. There is some plausibility
		in the demand that all who heal should educate
		themselves, if we had a true system of education,
		which we have not. But there is no justice in the
		demand that those whom nature has gifted with
		great healing powers should be prohibited from exercising
		their natural gifts, or giving advice to their
		neighbors, whenever they happen to know anything
		that is useful. To interfere with such acts
		of benevolence, which are really the performance
		of a religious duty, is a crime, and it is none the less
		criminal when it is the act of legislators, who are
		careless enough to allow themselves to be made the
		tools of an avaricious monopoly, which would
		make it a crime for a farmer’s wife to give her
		neighbor’s children a blackberry cordial or hoarhound
		syrup. When the law makes benevolence
		a crime, laws and legislators become objects
		of contempt, and a dangerous spirit of rebellion is
		fostered.</p>

		<p>In Illinois a law has been obtained from a careless
		and unthinking legislature, which makes all
		healing a crime, when not performed by graduated,
		licensed and registered practitioners, but the law
		is so odious that it is not enforced against those
		who are not administering medicines. In Iowa an
		equally disgraceful law has been obtained, designed
		to establish a similar monopoly, but the prosecution
		against a lady for assisting a patient with her
		prayers resulted in her acquittal, and the medical
		societies have been paralyzed as to its enforcement.
		Dr. R. C. Flower, of Boston, has made several
		addresses to large audiences in that State, in
		opposition to medical legislation, and the report of
		his very spirited and effective lecture in the Des
		Moines <cite>Register</cite> shows that he carried his audiences
		with him, and roused enthusiasm in opposition to
		the law. Dr. F. related some terrific cases of
		malpractice by eminent physicians, and portrayed
		the horrible effects of the law in upholding
		quackery.</p>

		<p>The present law of Mississippi is a disgrace to the
		civilization of that State. It would authorize the
		prosecution of any one who helped the sick, even
		by prayer, if the benevolent party was not protected
		by a medical license.</p>

		<p>In Alabama the law gives to the old school State
		medical association the entire control of medical
		practice, and the power to examine and license
		every one who does any practice. Under this law
		graduates of Eclectic colleges who are outside of
		the medical ring, have been prosecuted for non-compliance
		with the law, but the prosecution was
		defeated. Mississippi and Alabama need to be
		Americanized. Medical bigotry has carried them
		back to the dark ages, for there is not a country in
		Europe to-day which is not more enlightened and
		liberal in its medical legislation than these two
		States.</p>

		<p>Monopoly is one of the most formidable enemies
		of American liberty. It is now assuming the
		form of “Trust” combinations to raise prices, but
		there is no monopoly so grasping as the medical,—none
		which assumes to suppress competition by
		law.</p>

		<p>The plea of promoting education is as false as a
		proposal to elevate the pulpit by compelling
		every clergyman to pass through a Roman Catholic
		college. The existing medical colleges hold the
		same relation to the practice of the healing art as
		the Sectarian Theological Seminary to the practice
		of Christianity. One may be a very good Christian
		without the help of a theological seminary, or a
		very good doctor without the help of a medical
		college, but no one can be a first-class physician
		who goes through a medical college and adheres
		strictly to all the knowledge and all the ignorance
		administered by professors, without learning anything
		from other sources.</p>

		<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"> </a>MAYO’S ANÆSTHETIC.</h3>

		<p>The suspension of pain, under dangerous surgical
		operations, is the greatest triumph of Therapeutic
		Science in the present century. It came
		first by mesmeric hypnotism, which was applicable
		only to a few, and was restricted by the jealous
		hostility of the old medical profession. Then
		came the nitrous oxide, introduced by Dr. Wells,
		of Hartford, and promptly discountenanced by the
		enlightened (?) medical profession of Boston, and
		set aside for the next candidate, ether, discovered
		in the United States also, but far interior to the
		nitrous oxide as a safe and pleasant agent. This was
		largely superseded by chloroform, discovered much
		earlier by Liebig and others, but introduced as an
		anæsthetic in 1847, by Prof. Simpson. This proved
		to be the most powerful and dangerous of all.
		Thus the whole policy of the medical profession
		was to discourage the safe, and encourage the more
		dangerous agents. The magnetic sleep, the most
		perfect of all anæsthetic agents, was expelled from
		the realm of college authority; ether was substituted
		for nitrous oxide, and chloroform preferred to
		ether, until frequent deaths gave warning.</p>

		<p>Nitrous oxide, much the safest of the three, has
		not been the favorite, but has held its ground,
		especially with dentists. But even nitrous oxide is
		not perfect. It is not equal to the magnetic sleep,
		when the latter is practicable, but fortunately it is
		applicable to all. To perfect the nitrous oxide,
		making it universally safe and pleasant, Dr. U. K.
		Mayo, of Boston, has combined it with certain
		harmless vegetable nervines, which appear to control
		the fatal tendency which belongs to all anæsthetics
		when carried too far. The success of Dr.
		Mayo, in perfecting our best anæsthetic, is amply
		attested by those who have used it. Dr. Thorndike,
		than whom, Boston had no better surgeon, pronounced
		it “the safest the world has yet seen.”
		It has been administered to children and to patients
		in extreme debility. Drs. Frizzell and Williams,
		say they have given it “repeatedly in heart disease,
		severe lung diseases, Bright’s disease, etc., where
		the patients were so feeble as to require assistance
		in walking, many of them under medical treatment,
		and the results have been all that we could
		ask—no irritation, suffocation, nor depression.
		We heartily commend it to all as the anæsthetic of
		the age.” Dr. Morrill, of Boston, administered
		Mayo’s anæsthetic to his wife with delightful
		results when “her lungs were so badly disorganized,
		that the administration of ether or gas
		would be entirely unsafe.” The reputation of this
		anæsthetic is now well established; in fact, it is
		not only safe and harmless, but has great medical
		virtue for daily use in many diseases, and is coming
		into use for such purposes. In a paper before
		the Georgia State Dental Society, Dr. E. Parsons
		testified strongly to its superiority. “The nitrous
		oxide, (says Dr. P.) causes the patient when fully
		under its influence to have very like the appearance
		of a corpse,” but under this new anæsthetic
		“the patient appears like one in a natural sleep.”
		The language of the press, generally has been highly
		commendatory, and if Dr. Mayo had occupied so
		conspicuous a rank as Prof. Simpson, of Edinburgh,
		his new anæsthetic would have been adopted at
		once in every college of America and Europe.</p>

		<p class="ad_pstyle_1">Mayo’s Vegetable Anæsthetic.</p>

		<p>A perfectly safe and pleasant substitute for chloroform,
		ether, nitrous oxide gas, and all other
		anæsthetics. Discovered by Dr. U. K. Mayo, April,
		1883, and since administered by him and others in
		over 300,000 cases successfully. The youngest child,
		the most sensitive lady, and those having heart
		disease, and lung complaint, inhale this vapor with
		impunity. It stimulates the circulation of the
		blood and builds up the tissues. Indorsed by the
		highest authority in the professions, recommended
		in midwifery and all cases of nervous prostration.
		Physicians, surgeons, dentists and private families
		supplied with this vapor, liquefied, in cylinders of
		various capacities. It should be administered the
		same as Nitrous Oxide, but it does not produce
		headache and nausea as that sometimes does. For
